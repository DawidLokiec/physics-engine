# My Physics Engine
This CMake-based project is a reusable physics engine written in C++ 20.
It includes high performance computing functionality for commonly needed physics calculations, including important methods for N-body simulations.
Occasionally this library will be expanded by me over time.

## Features
- N-body simulation functionality
- Easily extensible and reusable
- CMake-based build system
- Cross-platform compatibility
